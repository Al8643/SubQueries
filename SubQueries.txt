Built-in database functions must be called from a programming language like Python.
Built-in database functions reduce the amount of data that is retrieved.
Built-in database functions may increase processing time.
Built-in database functions may increase network bandwidth consumed.

Correct. Built-in database functions reduce the amount of data that is retrieved.

data that is retrieved to the client machine is significantly reduced.

Q2: Which of the following SQL queries would return the day of the week each dog was rescued?

SELECT DAYOFWEEK(RescueDate) From PetRescue WHERE Animal = ‘Dog’;
SELECT DAY(RescueDate) From PetRescue WHERE Animal = ‘Dog’;
SELECT DAYOFWEEK(RescueDate) From PetRescue; 
SELECT RescueDate From PetRescue WHERE Animal = ‘Dog’;

Correct. SELECT DAYOFWEEK(RescueDate) From PetRescue WHERE Animal = ‘Dog’;
The DAYOFWEEK() function returns the day of the week, and the WHERE clause 
correctly specifies the animal as a dog.

Q3: What is the result of the following query: SELECT (Current_Date – RescueDate) FROM PetRescue

Returns how long it has been since each rescue.

Q4: Which of the following queries will return the employees who earn less than the 
average salary?

SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Salary < (SELECT AVG(Salary))
SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employees WHERE Salary < AVG(Salary) 
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Salary < (SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employees);
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Salary < AVG(Salary) 

Correct. SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Salary < (SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employees);
The AVG(Salary) function must be included in a sub-query within the WHERE clause.

Q5: What are the three ways to work with multiple tables in the same query?

Sub-queries, APPEND, JOIN operators
Built-in functions, implicit joins, JOIN operators
Sub-queries, Implicit joins, normalization.
Sub-queries, Implicit joins, JOIN operators

Correct. Sub-queries, Implicit joins, JOIN operators.
You can retrieve information from more than one table by using a sub-query, 
an implicit join, or a JOIN operator like INNER JOIN, LEFT OUTER JOIN, RIGHT OUTER JOIN, 
or FULL OUTER JOIN.
